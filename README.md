# Real-Time-Pollution-Monitoring-System
This system monitors air quality by measuring pollutants like Carbon Monoxide (CO), Ammonia (NHâ‚ƒ), and dust particles, using sensors such as MQ7, MQ135, and a dust sensor. It also integrates a GPS module to tag each measurement with accurate location coordinates, providing real-time environmental data with geographical context.
